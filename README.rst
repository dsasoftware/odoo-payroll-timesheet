Hibou - Timesheet Attendance on Payroll Payslips
************************************************

Provides worked days and hours line on Payslip based on employee timesheet attendances.

Use
===

Simply install the module, and all *approved* timesheet attendance lines will appear under a worked days line of "ATTN".

There will be a new contract field, under wage, for 'Paid Hourly' to be used in salary rules.

This module does not override any salary rules, but this is a sample BASIC rule to use the hours as an hourly employee.
This rule could be modified to include 'time and a half' style of overtime.
